Computes the matting loss function based on the matting Laplacian.

```python
tfg.image.matting.loss(
    matte, laplacian, name=None
)
```



<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

Computes the matting loss function based on the `laplacian` generated by the
`build_matrices` function which implements the approach proposed by Levin
et al. in "A Closed Form Solution to Natural Image Matting".

#### Args:


* <b>`matte`</b>: A tensor of shape `[B, H, W, 1]`.
* <b>`laplacian`</b>: A tensor of shape `[B, H - pad, W - pad, size^2, size^2]`
  containing the Laplacian matrices computed by the `build_matrices`
  function, where `pad` is equal to `size - 1` and `size` is the patch size
  used to compute this tensor.
* <b>`name`</b>: A name for this op. Defaults to "matting_loss".


#### Returns:

A tensor containing a scalar value defining the matting loss.



#### Raises:


* <b>`ValueError`</b>: If the last dimension of `matte` is not 1. If `matte` is not
of rank 4. If the last two dimensions of `laplacian` are not of the
same size. If `laplacian` is not of rank 5. If `B` is different
between `matte` and `laplacian`.
